Notes:

+ The script starts when the output/results sheet is opened, user can then choose to stop the script from doing its thing, or let it run!
+ The script uses a tmp folder in the root of the drive, if none is found, the script will create one!
+ If multiple tmp folders exist, the script will use the first one!
----------
+ The script creates temporary google sheet for every excel file,it deletes them once data extraction is done.
+ The user will be alerted when cleanup function is triggered (this happens in case the script fails to clear the converted excel sheets)
